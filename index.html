                    <p>Caty Fairclough is 5'2", but seems taller over the phone. Although, maybe that's just what she wants you to think. Ever since she was young, she's loved to write. It's helped her to see the world in new ways and allow her to take others with her on her journeys. Articles, poems, stories, and social media blurbs have become her tools for communicating with the virtual world around her. But what does she want to write about?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her main interests lie in the protection of animals and the ocean. She wants to use her words to help the world around her. And she's already started that! She was an intern at the <a href="http://www.ctaudubon.org/">Connecticut Audubon Society</a>, where she worked with children and taught them about the natural world around them. She's also written about animals and the ocean at the <a href="http://ocean.si.edu/">Smithsonian Ocean Portal</a> and at the <a href="http://theoceanproject.org/">Ocean Project</a>. Both these experiences allowed her to cast her words out into a digital ocean and reach many people. Caty's hope is that her writing will inspire others to care about the world as much as she does.

                    Go the resume section through the menu (or click <a href="./resume.html">here</a> to get there) for a more detailed history of her life and experiences. You can also <a href="#">download</a> her resume if that's more your thing.
