                <i>Once on a time my father slipped under the sea.</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                He came home with pockets full of sand dollars
                <br>
                and tales of dancing nudibranchs 
                <br>
                moving shell-less around their sea rose egg cluster

                <br>
                <br>
                As he talked the smell of brine cloaked us
                <br>
                covering everything -- a stampede of currents
                <br>
                migrated across the Earth while he crawled below
                <br>
                hurt by jealous coral polyps and moody rocks. 
                <br>                
                <br>
                He had been searching for something older than us
                <br>
                a twin to the birth of the sea, a place of foiltime
                <br>
                where movement becomes a shadow of stillness
                <br>
                and never is forever. 
                <br>
                <br>
                He came back defeated
                <br>
                and left his pile of sand dollars
                <br>
                on our kitchen table made of driftwood stained 
                <br>

                The young Catherine lost
                <br>            
                her mother -- a tragedy 
                <br>
                that burned her 
                <br>
                but she bandaged herself 
                <br>
                with pretty things
                <br>
                animals and dance and music
                <br>
                (and her music teacher).

                She hit court
                <br>
                like an asteroid. 
                <br>

                Marriage seemed expected at that point--

                middle of the summer heat and simplicity
                <br>
                turned Catherine into a June Queen,
                <br>
                but it was a long summer
                <br>
                and she was easily distracted 
                <br>
                with beautiful people 
                <br>
                hot spells.

                An affair is only an affair if a woman has it
                <br>
                and Catherine was exiled.

                She rehearsed laying her head on the block
                <br>
                as if she was to go to sleep -- 
                <br>
                Neck relaxed, hands knitted together
                <br>
                and ankles crossed like a lady.
                <br>
                Her eyes would flutter closed 
                <br>
                at the last moment
                <br>
                before the curtain came down.

                into a pit of anonymity
                <br>
                colored by lips painted 
                <br>
                blue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;skin becomes him
                <br>
                matches his eyes
                <br>
                looking towards the titanic
                <br>
                iceberg that could have saved them
                <br>
                as it killed them,
                <br>
                temporary refuge 
                <br>
                cold fighting cold. 
                <br>
                <br>
                But titans are destined
                <br>
                to fall and take an era
                <br>
                with them.

                <h4>A Bedtime Poem I:</h4> 
                <p class="poems">
                Peace my child,
                <br>
                float away
                <br>
                touch the blue sky-quilt
                <br>
                stained where silent dreams
                <br>
                hide in pinpricks
                <br>
                of light.
                <br>
                <br>
                Fill yourself
                <br>
                with galaxies 
                <br>
                of thoughts, never leaving 
                <br>
                you to loneliness.
                <br>
                <br>
                Peace my child,
                <br>
                come down
                <br>
                from above
                <br>
                sink to your bay of a bed
                <br>
                drop anchor in the deep
                <br>
                and sleep.
                </p>
