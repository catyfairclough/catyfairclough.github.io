                <h4>Education</h4>
                <p>I went to <a href="http://brandeis.edu">Brandeis University</a> in Waltham, MA. There, I duel majored in Environmental Studies and Creative Writing, because it was too hard to choose just one thing. After four years of a very diverse selection of courses, I graduated at the top of my class with magna cum laude.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also spent a semester abroad, studying at <a href="http://www.stir.ac.uk/">Stirling University</a> in Scotland. This gave me the wonderful opportunity to expand my comfort zone and experience new cultures. I got to learn about Scottish literature, aquaculture, and the biosphere. 
                </p>

                <h4>Experience</h4>
                    <p>Right now, I'm doing some freelance work for the <a href="http://theoceanproject.org/">Ocean Project.</a> I started interning there in the summer of 2014. While there, I managed social media accounts and wrote research-based posts and blogs that target several different demographics. I also created marketing plans and a content calendar. 
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    My marketing experience began in the summer of 2013, when I interned at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History's <a href="http://ocean.si.edu/">Ocean Portal</a>. During this experience, I researched topics, pitched ideas, and wrote blog posts. It was there that I became seriously enamoured with marketing and communications for good causes. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When I was a undergraduate Teaching Assistant at <a href="http://brandeis.edu">Brandeis University</a>, I worked with graduate students and helped them understand the course materials. There, I learned how to effectively communicate thoughts and ideas for the goal of educating students.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When I was an Intern at the <a href="http://www.ctaudubon.org/">Connecticut Audubon Society</a>, I co-taught groups of preschool-aged children. We taught them about natural resources, and I had to constantly think on my feet. When you combine children and nature, every day is a new experience! 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I've also done some more predictable work. For two consecutive summers, I've been an Administrative Assistant for an accountant in Connecticut. I assisted customers, organized the office, handled confidential information.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And those are just my highlighted experiences! I've also stage-managed a play at Brandeis and worked as a boat cover assistant (working at a drill press for hours a day gave me a real appreciation of manual labor!).
